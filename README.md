This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python related to a ZeroDivisionError. A function calculates the average of a list of numbers, including a check for an empty list. However, the random generation of number lists can lead to an exception if the random number generator produces an empty list despite the initial check. The solution shows robust handling of potential exceptions.
